# Prediction-of-Loan-Approval-Using-Machine-Learning
A Machine Learning model is used to explore Banking Data to predict if a client's Loan approval. 
Feature scaling such as minmax scaler and standard scaler are performed when dealing with Gradient Descent Based algorithms (Linear and Logistic Regression, Neural Network) and Distance-based algorithms (KNN, K-means, SVM) as these are very sensitive tothe range of the data points.
Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning is conducted using 6 supervised machine learning algorithms are uses to solve the classification problems including K-nearest neighbors (KNN), naivebayes, logistics regression, decision tree, random forest and support vectore machine (SVM).
We used GridSearchCV algorithm to obtain the optimal parameter for each model in order to get the best performance measurement value.
